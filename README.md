## Introduction
The simulator tool is dedicated for simulation of charging station. It implements [OCPP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Charge_Point_Protocol) and talks to Charging Station Management 
System (CSMS) via WebSocket protocol. At the moment only OCPP 2.0 (download [here](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-20/)) is supported.

# Usage
